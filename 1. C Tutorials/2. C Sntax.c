----------------------------------------------------------------
Notes Code breakdown.
----------------------------------------------------------------
*Line 1: #include <stdio.h>
        Line 1 is a Header File Library that allows us to work with Input and Output functions, such as printf().
        Header files add functionality to C programs.

*Line 2: A blank line. C ignores whitespace. But we use it to make the code more readable.

*Line 3: main()
        Another thing that appears in C programs is Main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curl bracket () will be executed.

*Line 5: printf()
        Printf() is a function that is used to output/print to the screen. In or example it will otput "Hello World"

*Note: Every C Statement ends with a semicolon (;)

*Line 6: return 0 ;
        return 0  ends the main() function.

Note: Do not forget to add the closing curly brackets '}' to actally  end the main function
